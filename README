MapViewController is View Controller subclass that handle Google Directions  
API.

It provides driving route on map and step by step text navigation.

Example use of this class is shown in MapDirectionsViewExample project.
Just subclass MapDirectionViewController and provide start and end point of navigation.

Enjoy to use it :)

Other projects that I have used in this project:
*SBJSON
*SVProgressHUD
*ASIHttpReqest
